# Contributing

Currently, the team maintaining this repo is small and time-constrained. While we appreciate all
contributions, we can't guarantee a timely response to every pull request or issue. We will review
these on a best-effort basis.

## Development Principles

- Keep PRs focused and under 300 LOC when possible.
- Add or update **unit tests** whenever possible.
- Document public APIs in Swift docstrings.
- **Commit** using Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat(recorder): add onBeforeStart callback API`).
- **Open a Pull Request** against `main` and fill in the PR template.
- Ensure that the project and its unit tests compile and run correctly.

## Issue Reporting

When filing an issue, please:
- Use the **Bug Report** or **Feature Request** template.
- Include reproduction steps or a failing test if applicable.
- Be respectful and follow our Code of Conduct.
